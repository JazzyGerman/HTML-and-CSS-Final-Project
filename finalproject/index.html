        <h3>Electric Guitar</h3>
        <article>
            <p>The electric guitar is a solid body instrument that has magnetic electronics called pick-ups. These send the vibrations of the strings through the pickups into a digital format and then that signal is played through a amplifier. Its common to add additional effects to this signal such as distortion, reverb, or delay. This is a excellent instrument for rock artists, metal bands, and shredders all over the world!</p>
